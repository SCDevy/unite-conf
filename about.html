                <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
                <p>Across the nation, <span class="bold">high-impact collegiate entrepreneurial organizations</span> are working to promote student entrepreneurship and foster a culture of innovation. At the University of Southern California, Spark SC’s biannual <span class="highlight">“Startup Career Fair”</span> has exposed over 2,000 students to startups in LA. This past year at Stanford University, the annual <span class="highlight">“BASES Challenge”</span> distributed over $100,000 to encourage student business and social venture ideas. At the University of Michigan, MPowered has exposed over 15,000 students to entrepreneurship through efforts like <span class="highlight">“1000 Pitches”</span> and their <span class="highlight">“Makeathon.”</span> With so much distributed effort and impact around the nation, we seem to be in a <span class="bold">“Golden Age”</span> of organized student entrepreneurship.</p>
                <p>There is, however, <span class="bold">one problem with these groups.</span> Despite the caliber of the work done by each university’s team, there has been almost <span class="bold">no communication</span> among them. Each university’s organization has had a single-minded focus on impact within their own community.</p>
                <p class="quote">Despite the caliber of the work done by each team, there has been almost <span class="bold">no communication.</span></p>
                <p>This lack of communication has done much to prevent organizations nation-wide from realizing their full potential as a cooperative force -- it’s time to collaborate. Alone, our efforts to promote entrepreneurship are localized to our respective regions, yet <span class="bold">united we are stronger and better-equipped to make long-lasting, far-reaching change across the nation.</span></p>
                <p class="shout">This is the inspiration behind UNITE.</p>
